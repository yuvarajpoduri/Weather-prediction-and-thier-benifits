    <p>Write down emergency phone numbers and keep them on the refrigerator or near every phone in your house. Program them into your cell phone too.
      Prepare an emergency supply kit.
      Locate the nearest shelter and different routes you can take to get there from your home. If shelter locations in your area have not been identified, learn how to find them in the event of a storm.
      Pet owners: Pre-identify shelters, a pet-friendly hotel, or an out-of-town friend or relative where you can take your pets in an evacuation. Local animal shelters may be able to offer advice on what to do with your pets if you are asked to evacuate your home.</p>

    <p>Activate the fire alarm.

      Call 911 immediately and provide information.
      
      Assist injured personnel or notify emergency responders of the medical emergency.
      
      Exit the building following emergency maps.
      
      Assist physically impaired individuals to a secure area and notify emergency responders.
      
      Ensure all personnel are out of the building.
      
      Do not use the elevators.
      
      Use a fire extinguisher only if safe to do so and you have been trained.
      
      Assemble personnel at a remote location noted on evacuation maps.
      
      Report hazardous conditions.
      
      Stay low if confronted with smoke. Check closed doors for heat before opening.

    <p>In most situations, you can protect yourself if you immediately:

      DROP down onto your hands and knees before the earthquake knocks you down. This position protects you from falling but allows you to still move if necessary.
      COVER your head and neck (and your entire body if possible) underneath a sturdy table or desk. If there is no shelter nearby, get down near an interior wall or next to low-lying furniture that won’t fall on you, and cover your head and neck with your arms and hands.
      HOLD ON to your shelter (or to your head and neck) until the shaking stops. Be prepared to move with your shelter if the shaking shifts it around.</p>

    <p>Be informed by receiving alerts, warnings, and public safety information before, during, and after emergencies.
      Find out whether your property is in a flood-prone or high-risk area. Explore the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) flood maps.
      Contact your local Emergency Management Director to find out if your home or workplace is downstream from a dam and learn more about your community’s risk of flooding.
      Create and review your family emergency plan.
      Have a plan to go to higher ground quickly if necessary.
      If you live or work in a flood zone, hurricane evacuation zone, or an area that is prone to flooding, you should be prepared to evacuate.
      Assemble an emergency kit.
      Make a record of your personal property by taking photos or videos of your belongings. Store these records in a safe place.
      Prepare your home for flooding.
      Flood losses are not typically covered under renter and homeowner’s insurance policies. Consider purchasing flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Plan (NFIP).</p>

    <p>Find out if your home, school, workplace or other frequently visited locations are in tsunami hazard areas. For high risk areas, know the earthquake and tsunami plans for each location. 
      Contact your municipality to know the risks, evacuation and alerting system in your community. Know the sound of the alert and make sure all in your family are familiar with it and what to do. Sign up for local alerts.
      For up-to-date information from coast to coast to coast, the Government of Canada and the Canadian National Seismograph Network monitor significant earthquake reports in Canada. 
      Make a personalized preparedness emergency kit. Families should be prepared to be self-sustaining for at least three days.
      Kits should include practical items such as drinking water, food, cash, and a portable radio. However, they should also include items that are unique to your own families’ needs. This could include baby items, medical prescriptions, pet food, etc.</p>
